### About the Project

This project is built as an online catering service platform that allows users to subscribe to healthy meal plans. The application separates roles between regular users and an admin, where the admin has access to a dedicated dashboard to monitor business statistics and manage user data. Its architecture uses the Next.js App Router with a separation of Server and Client components for optimal performance.

### Key Features

- üîê **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and logout system using NextAuth.js (Credentials Provider).
- üîë **Password Reset**: A complete forgot password workflow, sending a secure reset link via email using Resend.
- üë§ **User Profile**: A profile page where users can view and manage their subscription details, as well as update their personal information.
- üë®‚Äçüíª **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated admin page to view key statistics (revenue, new users, etc.) and a list of all subscribers. The admin role can only be assigned directly in the database.
- ü•ó **Dynamic Menu**: An interactive food menu display with nutritional details, pricing, and a popup for item details.
- üìù **Subscription Form**: A customization form where users can select plans, meal types, and delivery days to calculate the total monthly cost.
- üìû **Contact Page**: A contact form integrated with an external service (Web3Forms) for message management.
- üí¨ **Dynamic Testimonials**: Displays testimonials from random users fetched from the external `randomuser.me` API.
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Designed to look great on both mobile and desktop devices using Tailwind CSS.
